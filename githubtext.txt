# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis - Docker Setup

**Description:** Docker environment for running the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis project with Jupyter Notebook, machine learning libraries, and all dependencies pre-configured.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Download and Extract the Project

Download the zipped folder containing all files from this repository and extract it to a local directory of your choosing.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

In a terminal window, navigate to the local directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
cd path/to/sleep-health-analysis
```

### 3. Start the Docker Environment

Run the following command to download the Docker images and create the containers:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will:
- Build the Python environment with all dependencies
- Start the Jupyter Notebook server
- Display the access URL in the terminal

⏱️ **First run may take 3-5 minutes** as Docker downloads and builds the images.

### 4. Access Jupyter Notebook

In a web browser, copy and paste the custom URL provided in the terminal window. It will look similar to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr
```

Paste this full URL into your browser to access the Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 5. Run the Analysis

Once Jupyter opens:
- Navigate to and open `sleep_analysis.ipynb`
- Run all cells sequentially to execute the complete analysis

⏱️ **Note:** The analysis and model training (sections 3-4) may take **10-20 minutes** to complete.

## Stopping the Environment

To stop the Docker containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window, or run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove all containers and images, run:

```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you get a port error, edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and change the port mapping:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8889:8888"  # Changed from 8888:8888
```

Then access Jupyter at: `http://127.0.0.1:8889`

### Container Won't Start

Ensure Docker Desktop is running, then try:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

### View Logs

To see container logs and troubleshoot issues:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Analysis Workflow

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** - Feature engineering, categorical variable creation
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Four comprehensive visualizations of lifestyle factors, occupation, and sleep quality predictors
3. **Predictive Modeling** - Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
4. **Model Evaluation** - Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, confusion matrices, and performance metrics
